KSQL Basics
-----------

This tutorial demonstrates a simple workflow using KSQL to write
streaming queries against messages in {{ site.ak-tm }}.

### Write Streaming Queries with the KSQL CLI

Stream Processing Cookbook
--------------------------

The [Stream Processing
Cookbook](https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/stream-processing-cookbook)
contains KSQL recipes that provide in-depth tutorials and recommended
deployment scenarios.

Clickstream Data Analysis Pipeline
----------------------------------

Clickstream analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and
reporting aggregate data about which pages a website visitor visits and
in what order. The path the visitor takes though a website is called the
clickstream.

This tutorial focuses on building real-time analytics of users to
determine:

-   General website analytics, such as hit count and visitors
-   Bandwidth use
-   Mapping user-IP addresses to actual users and their location
-   Detection of high-bandwidth user sessions
-   Error-code occurrence and enrichment
-   Sessionization to track user-sessions and understand behavior (such
    as per-user-session-bandwidth, per-user-session-hits etc)

The tutorial uses standard streaming functions (i.e., min, max, etc) and
enrichment using child tables, stream-table join, and different types of
windowing functionality.

Get started now with these instructions:

-   [ksql\_clickstream-docker]{role="ref"}

If you do not have Docker, you can also run an [automated
version](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/tree/master/clickstream)
of the Clickstream tutorial designed for local Confluent Platform
installs. Running the Clickstream demo locally without Docker requires
that you have Confluent Platform installed locally, along with
Elasticsearch and Grafana.

KSQL Examples
-------------

[These examples \<ksql\_examples\>]{role="ref"} provide common KSQL
usage operations.

KSQL in a Kafka Streaming ETL
-----------------------------

To learn how to deploy a Kafka streaming ETL using KSQL for stream
processing, you can run the [Confluent Platform
demo](https://docs.confluent.io/current/tutorials/cp-demo/docs/index.html).
All components in the {{ site.cp }} demo have encryption,
authentication, and authorization configured end-to-end.
